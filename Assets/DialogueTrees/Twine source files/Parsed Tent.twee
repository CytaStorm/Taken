[[Continue->parchment]]


:: Finish eating. {"position":"3150,1850","size":"100,100"}

His ears perk up when he hears your reassurances, and he breathes a sigh of relief.

:: Stare at him back. {"position":"3150,1475","size":"100,100"}
A short Ifni gives a puzzled look back at you, his ears turning to the sounds around you: the howling winds and the crackling fire, and his tail swaying side to side. He continues to eat.
[[Continue->alright?]]


:: agreeToHelp {"position":"2050,700","size":"100,100"}
<b>SALLOS: </b>That's great! Here, just do this one, and we'll be fine.
[[Unwrap it->unwrap]]

<b>SALLOS: </b>You alright? I know you love watching my tail, but you haven't eaten much at all.
[[Ah! I just...->itsOk]]


:: beat {"position":"100,1350","size":"100,100"}
<b>SALLOS:</b> Awh, I'm sorry to hear that! But we just have a little bit more work to do.
[[Continue->work]]


:: blush {"position":"3800,1300","size":"100,100"}
You blush. The boy has a way with words, even in his faraway dialect of Ghuzian. You can feel the beat of your heart more now.

[[Continue->sleepSoon]]


:: boil {"position":"2125,1000","size":"100,100"}
Slowly, gently, you lower the cube into the water. The portions under the rolling waves begin to shimmer and dissolve, staining the water with a deep brown. Once most of the stock is submerged, you release it, letting it fully sink. Sallos does the same, and soon, the stew begins to thicken and become fragrant.
[[Continue->timeToEat]]


:: cannotCut {"position":"425,425","size":"100,100"}
You've already collect a fair amount of tinder. It'd probably be best for Sallos to take care of the firewood.
[[Continue->exitDeadTree]]


:: cannotGrabTinder {"position":"500,1050","size":"100,100"}
Your hands are already full of firewood. Best to let Sallos take care of these.

[[When do we get to the top?->whenTop]]


:: cut {"position":"725,400","size":"100,100"}
After some effort, you manage to get together a small bundle of logs. Enough to last the night, you reckon.

:: deadTree [start] {"position":"400,175","size":"100,100"}
The fallen tree collects snow. It seems to have fallen recently, judging by how little snow is atop the trunk. Did you hear it fall? The sound was probably drowned out by the wind.

:: edgeFormed {"position":"1475,1400","size":"100,100"}
You close your eyes do your best to conjure up an image of the sharpest edge you can imagine in your mind. Your head begins to ache slightly, but as you open your eyes, you see that the hatchet's head has regained its sharpness, the edge gaining a shiny coating contrasting with the surrounding rust and abuse.

<b>SALLOS:</b> Oh! You just need to get some firewood or tinder for me. There's a hatchet by the deadwood over there, and I think I saw good spot for foraging tinder a bit further past that.
[[Thank you.->sallosTalkedToExit]]


:: funny {"position":"3475,700","size":"100,100"}
<b>SALLOS:</b> It’s pretty funny thinking back, rescuing and then falling in love with you… and you still look exactly the same as the day we met.

[[Continue->older]]

Upon closer inspection, most of these are soaked through. Unsuitable for kindling.

The hatchet sits in on the ground quietly, resting after its long day of work.

(if: $sharpendHatchet is true ) [ [[Take a closer look->sharpHatchetLookCloser]] ]
[[Leave->exitHatchet]]


:: hatchetLookCloser {"position":"1575,1150","size":"100,100"}
You pick it up, and take a closer look at the head. It's been worn down after years of use. It's edge is chipped, and rust dots the surface. You could try to use some of your magic to reshape and restore it.
[[Sharpen the hatchet->sharpen]]


:: height {"position":"3775,1100","size":"100,100"}
<b>SALLOS:</b> It puts me at just the right height to look at you. Even if I can’t live as long as you, I’m happy that I can see you at the same level as me.

[[Continue->blush]]

<b>SALLOS: </b>I could use some help unpacking these though, if you'd like to help. They're on tight!

<b>SALLOS: </b>It's fine, I get it. But you probably should finish up soon. We need to get  to bed and ready for tomorrow! You're gonna need that energy!
[[Finish eating.]]

<b>SALLOS:</b> Whatever suits your tastes.

[[Continue->look]]


:: likeIt [start] {"position":"2325,1450","size":"100,100"}
<b>SALLOS:</b> Like it? I tried to make it as tasty as possible without using meat stuff. How’d I do?
[[It's good!->itsGood]]
[[It's bad!->itsBad]]


:: look {"position":"3400,950","size":"100,100"}
Sallos looks listfully at you, and you, back at him. 

[[Continue->reminds]]


:: lookAt {"position":"3150,1350","size":"100,100"}
He swallows, and picks up another spoonful.
[[Stare at him back.]]


:: makeHoosh {"position":"3175,925","size":"100,100"}
<b>SALLOS:</b> If you’d like, you can also put your pemmican in the water to make some hoosh. I’ve still got some biscuits for that as well.

[[I am alright, water is just fine.->justWater]]
[[Sure!->makeIt]]


:: makeIt {"position":"3150,700","size":"100,100"}
You drop the rest of your pemmican in the water, and Sallos puts in a biscuit. It slowly disintegrates, turning the water into a thin soup, the vegetables floating around lazily as they detach from the body of the block. 

[[Continue->look]]


:: older {"position":"3475,950","size":"100,100"}
He, however, doesn’t. In the years since you first met him, he’s gotten older, lost some of the roundness in his face and gained a few marks and nicks. Proof that he’s been alive, he’s always said. That being said, he’s not grown taller by much.

[[I've changed my hair! And what about you? You've not grown an inch, either! Watch out, or soon enough, I'll be taller than you!->sigh]]


:: parchment {"position":"1700,775","size":"100,100"}
He pulls out a handful of parchment wrapped cubes, tied with pieces of string.

He reaches over to you and pinches your cheek.

Sallos did say that pine cones are good for kindling, right?

<b>SALLOS: </b>Really?
[[Really.]]
[[No.->eatAnyways]]


:: reminds {"position":"3350,725","size":"100,100"}
<b>SALLOS:</b> You know, eating like this reminds me a lot of when we first met all those years ago. We ate a meal just like this. Except it was just biscuits and water for you. Didn’t have the veggies back then!

[[That really was awful… But you did save my life out there. And we met.->funny]]


:: sallosDiscussion [start] {"position":"1700,425","size":"100,100"}
Sallos sits by the pot, watching the water slowly heat up.

[[Continue->waterBoiling]]


:: scene [start] {"position":"100,50","size":"100,100"}
Your legs are burning, and your breathing is labored. But you and Sallos have finished pitching the tent.

[[Finally, we're done! The tent is all set up! I need a break!->wear]]


:: sharpHatchetLookCloser {"position":"1300,1050","size":"100,100"}
Thanks to your efforts, the hatchet has been sharpened to a razor's edge.
[[Leave->exitHatchet]]


:: sharpen {"position":"1650,1325","size":"100,100"}
You focus your mana, and touch the blade. You feel as is a wind is blowing across your arm, and the axe head begins to glow blue, and it begins to deform and almost melt.

He lets out an exasperated sigh.

SALLOS: Anyways, we should probably finish up soon. We should catch some rest as soon as possible. I want to catch the sunrise at the peak.

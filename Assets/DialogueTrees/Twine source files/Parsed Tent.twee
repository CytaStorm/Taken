His ears perk up when he hears your reassurances, and he breathes a sigh of relief.

:: Stare at him back. {"position":"3150,1475","size":"100,100"}
A short Ifni gives a puzzled look back at you, his ears turning to the sounds around you: the howling winds and the crackling fire, and his tail swaying side to side. He continues to eat.

Slowly, gently, you lower the cube into the water. The portions under the rolling waves begin to shimmer and dissolve, staining the water with a deep brown. Once most of the stock is submerged, you release it, letting it fully sink. Sallos does the same, and soon, the stew begins to thicken and become fragrant.

You've already collect a fair amount of tinder. It'd probably be best for Sallos to take care of the firewood.

The fallen tree collects snow. It seems to have fallen recently, judging by how little snow is atop the trunk. Did you hear it fall? The sound was probably drowned out by the wind.

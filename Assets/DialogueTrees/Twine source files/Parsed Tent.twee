Then, he adds in a few logs at a time, and before long, the flame is roaring, and the tent is now much warmer.

<b>SALLOS:</b> Awh, I'm sorry to hear that! But we just have a little bit more work to do.

:: bite {"position":"2925,575","size":"100,100"}
You take a bite, and it rips and crumbles a bit, like a very greasy cake. Slimy, almost.

[[Continue->likeIt]]


:: blush {"position":"3650,1250","size":"100,100"}
You blush. The boy has a way with words, even in his faraway dialect of Ghuzian. You can feel the beat of your heart more now.

You've already collect a fair amount of tinder. It'd probably be best for Sallos to take care of the firewood.

Your hands are already full of firewood. Best to let Sallos take care of these.

After some time, the string comes apart.

After some effort, you manage to get together a small bundle of logs. Enough to last the night, you reckon.

The fallen tree collects snow. It seems to have fallen recently, judging by how little snow is atop the trunk. Did you hear it fall? The sound was probably drowned out by the wind.

:: edgeFormed {"position":"1475,1400","size":"100,100"}
You close your eyes do your best to conjure up an image of the sharpest edge you can imagine in your mind. Your head begins to ache slightly, but as you open your eyes, you see that the hatchet's head has regained its sharpness, the edge gaining a shiny coating contrasting with the surrounding rust and abuse.

Upon closer inspection, most of these are soaked through. Unsuitable for kindling.

[[Leave->exitHatchet]]


:: hatchetLookCloser {"position":"1575,1150","size":"100,100"}
You pick it up, and take a closer look at the head. It's been worn down after years of use. It's edge is chipped, and rust dots the surface. You could try to use some of your magic to reshape and restore it.
[[Sharpen the hatchet->sharpen]]


:: height {"position":"3650,1025","size":"100,100"}
<b>SALLOS:</b> It puts me at just the right height to look at you. Even if I can’t live as long as you, I’m happy that I can see you at the same level as me.

Your eyes light up, and your stomach growls loudly.

Sallos looks listfully at you, and you, back at him.

<b>SALLOS:</b> If you’d like, you can also put your pemmican in the water to make some hoosh. I’ve still got some biscuits for that as well.

[[I am alright, water is just fine.->justWater]]
[[Sure!->makeIt]]


:: makeIt {"position":"3025,700","size":"100,100"}
You drop the rest of your pemmican in the water, and Sallos puts in a biscuit. It slowly disintegrates, turning the water into a thin soup, the vegetables floating around lazily as they detach from the body of the block. 

[[Continue->look]]


:: older {"position":"3275,800","size":"100,100"}
He, however, doesn’t. In the years since you first met him, he’s gotten older, lost some of the roundness in his face and gained a few marks and nicks. Proof that he’s been alive, he’s always said. That being said, he’s not grown taller by much.

[[I've changed my hair! And what about you? You've not grown an inch, either! Watch out, or soon enough, I'll be taller than you!->sigh]]

He pulls out a handful of parchment wrapped cubes, tied with pieces of string.

He reaches over to you and pinches your cheek.

Sallos did say that pine cones are good for kindling, right?

<b>SALLOS:</b> You know, eating like this reminds me a lot of when we first met all those years ago. We ate a meal just like this. Except it was just biscuits and water for you. Didn’t have the veggies back then!

[[That really was awful… But you did save my life out there. And we met.->funny]]

Sallos sits by the pot, watching the water slowly come to a boil.

Your legs are burning, and your breathing is labored. But you and Sallos have finished pitching the tent.

[[Finally, we're done! The tent is all set up! I need a break!->wear]]


:: setFire {"position":"1125,700","size":"100,100"}
Sallos puts the sticks into the stove, and begins striking an iron rod to get a spark. After a few attempts, the kindling catches, and the tent lights up. The embers in the stove make a light crackle as they smoulder, giving off the barest of light and warmth.
[[Continue->addWood]]


:: sharpHatchetLookCloser {"position":"1300,1050","size":"100,100"}
Thanks to your efforts, the hatchet has been sharpened to a razor's edge.
[[Leave->exitHatchet]]


:: sharpen {"position":"1650,1325","size":"100,100"}
You focus your mana, and touch the blade. You feel as is a wind is blowing across your arm, and the axe head begins to glow blue, and it begins to deform and almost melt.

He lets out an exasperated sigh.

SALLOS: Anyways, we should probably finish up soon. We should catch some rest as soon as possible. I want to catch the sunrise at the peak.

The bar is waxy, and looks like a brick made of peas and dirt. Not very appetizing, however edible it is.
